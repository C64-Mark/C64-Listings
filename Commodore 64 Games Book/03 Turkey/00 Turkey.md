03 Turkey (page 16)

Attempt to keep the turkey in the air as long as possible by manoeuvering the waiter underneath it and then bouncing it off the platter.

You control the waiter with the 'Z' (left) and 'M' (right) key. The turkey can be dropped twice but becomes inedible after the third time and the game ends.

Modifications in the assembly version:

1. Changed the title bar to pad out the score and add the word 'lives'. Colours added to this line as appropriate
2. Shifted the position of the sprites within their frames to aid calculation of collision
3. Hardware sprite collision isn't used. Instead the X/Y positions of the turkey and waiter are use to detect a collision
