03 Turkey (page 16)

Attempt to keep the turkey in the air as long as possible by manoeuvering the waiter underneath it and then bouncing it off the platter.

You control the waiter with the 'Z' (left) and 'M' (right) key. The turkey can be dropped twice but becomes inedible after the third time and the game ends.
