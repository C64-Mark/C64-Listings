02 Poetry (page 13)

Sit back and watch as the program writes poetry before your very eyes. Try making changes to the poem's words to make it ridiculous or humourous or just try and give it more to write.

Press 'N' key to stop the program or any other key for another poem.

Modifications made to assembly version:

1. The words and sentences are padded out to fixed lengths with a zero bit (@) to terminate them. This is to make it easier to select random words and sentences with an algorithm.
2. Some minor spelling corrections :D
3. A line is left between each line of poetry - mostly so I didn't have to deal with lines that wrapped over two lines
4. The program asks the user if they'd like another poem and scans for Y & N, rather than just N
