01 Paranoid (page 9)

Just sit back and watch the machine print a kaleidoscope of graphics patterns. When you've had enough just 'stop' the program. For an entirely different pattern re-run the program.

This is an easy, short program that has pretty impressive results. Use it in understanding your machine's graphics capabilities or just something to occupy your screen (and spectators) while you are doing something else.

Changes made to assembly version:

None. This is a straight translation based heavily on the conversion done by @OldSkoolCoder (John Dale)

Files included:

Original BASIC listing from the book
Original T64 of the BASIC version
PRG file of the assembly version
ASM files used in the remake
CBM PRG Studio file containing BASIC and ASM files
